# 11ty Basics

> A barebones demo of basic but essential 11ty features.

This was created to support the [livestream walkthrough](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/680500566) with [@edieblu](https://www.twitch.tv/edieblu).

> Check out the ["Steps to Create From Scratch"](https://github.com/5t3ph/11ty-basics/blob/master/StepsToCreate.md) which match the livestreamed steps

## Development Scripts

**`npm run develop`**

> Run 11ty with hot reload at localhost:8080
